# Gfapi Rust Bindings [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cholcombe973/Gfapi-sys.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cholcombe973/Gfapi-sys)
The gfapi-sys crate provides declarations and linkage for the 
Gluster gfapi C library. Following the *-sys package conventions, 
the gfapi-sys crate does not define higher-level abstractions over the native gfapi library functions.

For information on how to use this library see: https://gluster.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Features/libgfapi/
